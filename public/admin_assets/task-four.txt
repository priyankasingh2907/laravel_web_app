Note: We will use ajax to save form data so you must know how ajax works. 
      If you don't know, don't worry, I'll show a very easy process of how ajax works.

0) Load common scripts
   a) We will use "summernote" as a text editor, so we have to include its js file and initialize it in the footer.
   b) We will use dropzone as an ajax file uploader, so we have to include its js file.
   c) During image upload we will generate thumbnails so we will use a library called "Image Intervention".

      https://image.intervention.io/v2/introduction/installation
      
      👉🏻 composer require intervention/image

      In the $providers array add the service providers for this package.
      Intervention\Image\ImageServiceProvider::class

      Add the facade of this package to the $aliases array.
      'Image' => Intervention\Image\Facades\Image::class


1) Create a Controller named "ServiceController" using the following artisan command.
   👉🏻 php artisan make:controller admin\ServiceController
   
   Let's create six methods inside ServiceController
   a) index => This method will show the services.
   b) create => This method will display create service form.
   c) save => This method will insert service in database
   d) edit => This method will show, a service edit form where you can update an existing service.
   e) update => This method will update the service in DB.
   f) delete => This method will delete a service from DB.

2) First we will work on create service section, so we have to create a form.
   a) create a blade named "create.blade.php" in the following location.
      resources\views\admin\services\create.blade.php
   b) Let's create service form with dropzone upload field.
   
3) Create a controller called "TempImageController"
   This controller will be linked with dropzone and it will temproary save images.
   a) create "uploads" folder inside public directory
   b) create "temp" folder inside uploads directory
   c) create "temp_files" table in database.
   d) create "TempFile" model

4) Inside "TempImageController" create a method named "upload", this method will upload
   temp images and save a temp record in DB.

5) Create following folder inside public folder
   services/thumb/large => 1150 Maintain aspect ratio
   services/thumb/small => 360X220 Strict

6) Now validate and save service in DB using "ServiceController".

List *******

7) First we will create a blade called 'list.blade.php' which will show all services.
   resources/views/admin/services/list.blade.php

8) In "index" method of "ServiceController" we will fetch all services and pass to "list" view.

9) In "list" view will use foreach loop to list all services.

10) To show pagination we will use the following code.
   {{ $resultArray->links('pagination::bootstrap-4') }}

Edit *******

11) In listing page we will create a link which will redirect us to edit service page. In "edit" method we  
    will fetch the data of specfic service clicked data and will load on "edit" form.

12) Let's create route to show the edit service page, and this route will be linked with "edit"   
    method of  of ServiceController.

13) Create a blade called "edit.blade.php" and load in edit method of "ServiceController".
    resources\views\admin\services\edit.blade.php

14) Copy the code of "create.blade.php" and paste in "edit.blade.php".

15) Now, we have to validate the form and update data in DB. We will use "update" method of     
    "ServiceController" to validate and update data in DB. 

*****
Delete a service

16) In listing page when user will click on delete icon, we will show a javascript confirm alert, if user   click on Yes, then we will delete the record from DB.

17) Here we will use "delete" method to delete a record.
